<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<dl>
<dt>I can't connect with my web browser!
<dd>Maybe you have an HTTP proxy set up.  Try referring to your machine by its name instead of using localhost.

<dt>It crashes!
<dd>Yuck.  I can send you a version with extra information with debugging information turned on.
When you get a crash, click on "debugger" in the crash window, type "sc" then enter in the debugger
window, and <a href="mailto:svanegmond@home.com">e-mail me</a> what you get back.  Make sure to tell me anything you were doing at the time.

<dt>Clicking rewind makes the player freak out!
<dd>In particular, it will try to rewind at -18000% and the player won't be able to keep up.
This is a bug in SoundPlay versions 4.3 and before.  Check for the <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/156">latest release of SoundPlay</a> for a fix.

<dt>Nothing's showing up!
<dd>Did you run the installer and let it build mp3 indexes on your volumes?

<dt>How do I turn on looping?
<dd>Turn on the WinAMP user interface, click on the little looping button, then go
back to the nice BeOS interface.

<dt>It quits when I empty all the playlists!
<dd>This is the normal behaviour when you are running the WinAMP skin.  I can't prevent it.
The only solution is to either never empty the playlists OR don't use the WinAMP skin.
