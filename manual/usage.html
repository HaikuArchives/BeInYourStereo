<h2>Turning on the SoundPlay plugin</h2>
Start SoundPlay.  Bring up its preferences window. 
Turn on the plugin using <a href="img/prefs.png">this screen shot</a> if you need a guide.
Open the settings and tune them as you please.  You'll probably find what's there OK.

<table align=right><tr><Td>
<img src="img/config.png">
<br><b>The configuration panel for the plugin.</b>
</td></tr></table>

<P>Here are what the available settings mean:

<h4>Preferred skin</h4>
A "skin" in Be in your Stereo is the look and feel of the program.  The skin
is what you see through your web browser.  <b>Be in your Stereo</B> lets you
completely customize the appearance and behaviour using skins.

<P><img align=left src="img/prefs-2.png">
This setting is a popup-menu with a listing of all the directories in the skin folder.
Each directory is assumed to contain one skin.  The folder listing is live - that is,
if you add new skins to the folder, the menu will be up to date immediately.

<P>Choosing a skin here will change which directory the internal web server serves
files from, and hence the way the program looks and feels.

<P>The "Open Skins Folder" button will open a Tracker window on the skins folder
so you can look around.  "Download Skins" will spawn a web browser on the web site where
you can download new skins.



<h4>Use built-in web server</h4>
Be in your Stereo has a <a href="webserver.html">very basic web server</a> built-in
that is
probably "good enough" for basic needs and playing around.
Turn on this check box to run the web server.

<P>The built-in web server has only one option: which port the web server listens on.
For instance, if you indicate you want the web server to listen on port 4567,
you should access the url <tt>http://127.0.0.0.1:4567/</tt> to see Be in your Stereo.

<p>If the internal web server is not good enough for your purposes, BIYS can operate
with any web server that is smart enough to call PHP.  It has been tested with <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/322">Robin
Hood</a> with the <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/1883">PHP Handler</a>.  Consult your web server's documentation to learn how to set it up to use PHP.  The


<h4>Producer attribute</h4>

up to the Producer attribute.
TODO - document this more.

<h2>Using the plugin</h2>
TODO - rewrite based on the new skins.

<P>
Now for the fun part.  Start a browser, and point it at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080">http://127.0.0.1:8080</a>.
If it doesn't work, look at <a href="notes.html#e1">troubleshooting</a>.

We'll start with what you would see if you didn't have anything in SoundPlay's playlists.
<div align=center>
<table><tr><Td>
<img src="img/empty.png">
<br><b>Nothing playing.</b>
</td></tr></table></div>

<P>If you have something playing, on the other hand, you'll see something like this:

<table align=right><tr><Td>
<img src="img/empty-not.png">
<br><b>A few files in the playlist.</b>
</td></tr></table>

<P>There are a few features to notice here.  The standard play controls are present:
click on <b>pause</b> to stop playback, then again to resume playback.   Click <b>ffwd</b> to
kick SoundPlay into 400%-speed playback, then again to go back to normal speed.   <b>rewind</b> will do
the same thing, but in reverse.  The <b>next</b> and <b>previous</b> buttons will jump to the
next and previous tracks in the playlist.

<P>On the right are controls that affect the entire playlist: 
The <b>clear</b> button is like the eject button in SoundPlay's user interface:
it throws out the entire playlist.  The <b>sort</b> and <b>shuffle</b> buttons rearrange the playlist accordingly.
Sorting is based purely on filename (because that's how SoundPlay does it, and SoundPlay is doing it for us).

<P>Below the play buttons are volume and track-position controls. For volume, the leftmost dash is complete
silence.  The rightmost dash is the loudest SoundPlay can go.  For track position, the leftmost dash is the beginning
of the song, and the rightmost is the very end of the song.  These sliders show you what the current volume and track
position are with a <u>+</u>.

<P>Clicking on the name of any song will jump straight to that song in the playlist, and clicking on the <u>x</b> next
to a song will remove that song from the playlist.  The up and down arrows can be used to rearrange files in the playlist.


<P>Although not pictured here, if you have the download-links option turned on, there will be
a button that will let you pull down a copy of the audio file to your local computer.

<p>The "Add Tracks" button leads to the best features of the plugin, the cross-indexing of all your audio files:

<div align=center>
<table><tr><Td>
<img src="img/tracklist.png">
<br><b>Cross-referenced view of your audio file collection.</b>
</td></tr></table></div>

<P>There are four sections guaranteed to show up here.  The plugin has looked at all your audio files,
and determined the unique <b>year</b>, <b>genre</b>, <b>artist</b>, and <b>album</b> attribute values
on those files.  In the example above, there are two different years, two genres, and many artists represented on three albums.

<P>The individual audio files which compose your collection will be listed next, if there aren't too many.
If there are more than 60, the list will be suppressed.

<p>Clicking down into, say, the Soundtrack genre gives me this:

<div align=center>
<table><tr><Td>
<img src="img/genreview.png">
<br><b>A genre with one album.</b>
</td></tr></table></div>

<P>In this case, there is one album represented (Run Lola Run) with only one artist (Twycker).  Notice that the Year attribute
has been suppressed.  Which attributes are cross-referenced depends on which one you're looking at, in a
way which I hope is sensible.

<P>
Looking at the <b>Global Underground</b> genre, we see a remix album:

<div align=center>
<table><tr><Td>
<img src="img/genreview2.png">
<br><b>A genre with two albums, one of which is a remix album (with many artists on it).</b>
</td></tr></table></div>

<P>
Here, there's two albums: <b>GU016 Cape Town</b> by Dave Seaman and <b>Prototype 1</b> by Seb Fontaine, both published
by the Global Underground label.   I've given them their own genre (they deserve it).
In this case, Dave Seaman's album is in many tiny audio files, with the original artists listed on the Artist attribute.

<blockquote>
Perhaps this is a case for a <b>DJ</b> attribute, that's read along with (or besides or instead of) the Artist attribute.
I could use your input if you have an opinion -
see the <a href="notes.html#f">giving help</a> section.
</blockquote>

Looking at Seb Fontaine's artist index, we see the one track:

<div align=center>
<table><tr><Td>
<img src="img/albumview2.png">
<br><b>Seb Fontaine has one audio file in my collection.
</td></tr></table></div>

<P>Drilling down into the GU016 album, we see the rest of the Global Underground tracks:

<div align=center>
<table><tr><Td>
<img src="img/albumview.png">
<br><b>A view of one album - a remix album with many artists on it.
</td></tr></table></div>

<P>
Let's say that we decide to click on the <b>(add them all)</b> link now.  This will take us back to the playlist:

<div align=center>
<table><tr><Td>
<img src="img/tracksadded.png">
<br><b>A playlist with the GU016 album added to it.
</td></tr></table></div>

<P>
... and we can start partying!


<hr>
<h2>Some things that might not be obvious</h2>

<b>If you have multiple playlists</b> going in SoundPlay, the plugin will render them in a sensible way,
allowing you to control their playback, volume, track, etc. independently.  Attempting remixes is not recommended. :)

<P><b>If you change the value of an attribute</b>, the plugin will notice and do the appropriate reindexing.
Please note that the plugin is not watching for new filename changes.

<p><b>Which volumes are scanned?</b> When the SoundPlay plugin starts, it will look through any BFS
volumes that have indices built on Audio:Artist, Audio:Genre, Audio:Year, and Audio:Album attributes.
BFS is not specifically required, only the ability to attribute searches.  For now that implies only BFS, and forever
that excludes Windows (FAT16/32) and Linux (ext2).  If you have a new volume you want included, mount it, then restart SoundPlay.

<P><b>What if I unmount a volume?</b>  BeOS (correctly) refuses to do that as long as SoundPlay has scanned the
some items on the disk.  To unlock the drive so you can unmount or eject it,
quit SoundPlay, then unmount the volume in question.
