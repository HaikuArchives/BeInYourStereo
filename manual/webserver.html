The built-in web server <em>always</em> serves files from the location
<tt>/boot/home/config/settings/biys/current_skin/</tt>.  That file is actually
a symlink that is adjusted to point to your preferred skin when you use the skin-selector
in the plugin's preferences. 

<P>It is strongly recommended that if you set up a web server like Apache or
Robin Hood, that you tell it to use <tt>/boot/home/config/settings/biys/current_skin/</tt>
for its document root. This way, the preference dialog's skin selector will continue to work.

<h3>Details on the built-in web server's capabilities</h3>

To keep things simple, BIYS ships with a basic web server built in.  It has one
parameter:

<ol>
<li>What port to listen to
</ol>

It has none of the features you would expect from a real web server,
such as authentication, database connectivity, configurable logging,
or multiple hosts.

<P>The web server knows that some types of files are static (i.e. unchanging).
Static files are sent straight to the web browser unchanged.  The server code
decides based on file extension - not BeOS attributes - whether a file is static.
The filenames that are recognized as static are

<Div align=center>
<Table border=1>
<tr><Th>extension</th><th>MIME type</th></tr>
<tr><Td>gif</td><Td>image/gif</td></tr>
<tr><Td>jpeg</td><Td>image/jpeg</td></tr>
<tr><Td>jpg</td><Td>image/jpeg</td></tr>
<tr><Td>png</td><Td>image/png</td></tr>
<tr><Td>html</td><Td>text/html</td></tr>
<tr><Td>txt</td><Td>text/plain</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

Everything else is sent to PHP for processing.   PHP is expected to be in your
path, and have the command name "php".
