<h1>Customizing Be in your Stereo</h1>

<P>If you find yourself wishing that certain things in the application were <em>slightly</em> different than they are now, the good news that it's easy to tweak the application, to the point of reinventing the user interface.

<p>The first thing to do is get a decent editor.  <a href="http://www.el34.com/">Eddie</a> is a good choice; you may prefer something else from <A href="http://bebits.com/browse/118">BeBits</a>.

<P>The next step is to use the editor to look around at the files for the <b><a href="file:///boot/home/config/settings/biys/current_skin/">current skin</a></b> and get familiar with it.   A good point to start is the skin's <b><a href="file:///boot/home/config/settings/biys/current_skin/index.php">first page</a></b>, generally kept in a file called index.php.  (If you're using these links, use your browser's "view source" or "Show HTML" function.)

<P>When you have a half hour or so to spare, use it to read through the <b><a href="api/">Be in your Stereo programmer's reference</a></b>. Don't be afraid if you don't know much about programming - you can learn as you go.

<h2>Getting help</h2>
